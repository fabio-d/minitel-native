## Assembling the board

<p align="center">
<img src="pictures/headers.jpg" width="40%" />
<img src="pictures/headers_cut.jpg" width="40%" />
</p>

Solder the headers as shown in the pictures.

The tall headers, which are necessary for the NFZ 330 only, must be bent towards
the side. The remaining excess length of the legs can be trimmed away with a
cutter. The 2-pin header is only for NFZ 330, too.

The round hole headers are only necessary for the NFZ 400.

## Installation

### RTIC Minitel 1 (NFZ 330)

If the Minitel originally had a ROM board inserted in the ROM slot, it is enough
to simply replace it with the new board.

If the Minitel did not have a ROM board (i.e. it would normally boot from the
8052's integrated ROM and the external ROM slot was unpopulated), it is
necessary to also drive the CPU's External Access (EA) pin (#30) to GND. This
can be done with the following DIY cable:

<p align="center">
<img src="pictures/nfz330_clip.jpg" width="40%" />
</p>

Material:
* One 2-pin female header
  ([AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32854239374.html)), or a longer
  one cut accordingly.
* Grabber probe
  ([AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006975901107.html)).
* Wire, to be soldered to both pins on the header side and then hot-glued to
  make it stronger. The probe side must be soldered too.

The probe needs to be attached to the resistor on the Minitel's logic board as
shown in the picture. **Explanation**: the logic board's resistor is a pull-up
that would drive EA high, thus selecting the integrated ROM. By connecting it to
GND (exposed on both adapter board's pins, see the [Pinout](#pinout) below), EA
is driven low, thus selecting the external ROM. The reason why this cable is not
needed in Minitels that originally came with external ROMs is that their
resistor was soldered in the factory in a slighly different position, which
makes it act as a pull-down rather than a pull-up.

### Philips Minitel 2 (NFZ 400)

Installation is straighforward: after removing the old ROM, insert the board
in the proper orientation. Please note that this connector seems to be very
prone to poor contact. A good solution is to slightly pre-bend the adapter
board's pins in alternating directions:

<p align="center">
<img src="pictures/nfz400_bend.jpg" width="40%" />
</p>

After insertion, it is strongly advised to check continuity with a multimeter
between the adapter board's pins, whose solder joints are accessible from the
top side after removing the Pico, and the corresponding CPU pins. Good `PSEN`
contact is especially important to avoid electrical damage due to bus conflicts.
Note that some pins are not connected, see the [Pinout](#pinout) below.
